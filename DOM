//Starter Code
//<style> tag connects HTML with CSS.
//<script> tag connects HTML with JS.

//Window Object
//The window object represents an open window in a browser.It is browers's object(not JavaScipt's) and 
//is automatically created by browser.
//It is a global object with lots of properties and methods.

//What is DOM?
//When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model(DOM) of the page.

//DOM is usd to make dynamic changes/manipulation.
//DOM Manipulation:
//selecting with id:
document.getElementById("myId")
//when the element having that id does not exist, we get null.
//selecting with class
document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")
//when the element having that class doesnot exist we get empty html collection.
//selecting with tag
document.getElementsByTagName("p")

let heading = document.getElementById("heading");
console.dir(heading);
